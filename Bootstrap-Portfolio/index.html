                            <p>Hello, my name is Eric Ward and I want to tell you a few things about me. I was born
                                and raised in Delaware, and the youngest of 7 kids. While in 8th grade, I went on a
                                field trip to Russia for 10 days. That was in 1991. <br> <br> In high school I took 4
                                years of Spanish class and I also had friends
                                from diverse cultures and backgrounds. When I was 19, I was a missionary for my
                                church (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) in Paraguay where I spoke
                                Spanish and learned the Guarani language. <br> <br> A
                                few
                                years
                                later, in 2001, I married a beautiful and intelligent girl from Peru. We met in
                                Utah. We have 5 kids; 3 boys and 2 girls, and my family is the treasure in my life.
                                As a family, we love to travel. We have been to Peru a few times, Mexico a couple of
                                times, gone on two cruises, Disneyland, Dana Point (CA), Oregon, and Delaware.
                                <br> <br>
                                Most recently, we went to Portland, Oregon to visit my brother-in-law at
                                Christmastime.
                                One day we traveled to Seaside, OR and enjoyed the beach and got to eat some fish
                                and
                                chips.</p>
